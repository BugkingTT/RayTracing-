    这个项目是我根据很久之前获得的一个可执行项目修改而来，原项目中，基本物体只有球体和平板，我增加了三角形，四边形，圆面，三棱柱，立方体，以及联合体。
    作为一个经典的光线跟踪项目，这个项目给了我很多学习的机会。由于时间已经过去了很久，我已经找不到次项目的出处。只能在次再次感谢开源此项目的作者。

     This project is a modification of an executable project I obtained a long time ago. In the original project, the basic objects were only spheres and flat plates. I added triangles, quadrilaterals, circular faces, triangular prisms, cubes, and unions.
      As a classic ray tracing project, this project has given me many opportunities to learn. Since time has passed, I can't find the source of this project. I can only thank the author of this project again.
